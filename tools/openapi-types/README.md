# OpenAPI Types Generator

there are several projects that aim to generate TypeScript types from an OpenAPI / Swagger schema file. Some of them also offer to generate client code directly.

I have tested:

* https:// openapi-generator is very comprehensive and has the most commits, but unfortunately broke with an error for me.tech/
* https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript
* https://github.com/koshevy/codegena
* https://github.com/horiuchi/dtsgenerator

In my tests, most of them did not work well, at least not with the Swagger schema file generated by the strapi documentation plugin. Openapi-generator is very comprehensive and has the most commits, but unfortunately stops with an validation error for me. Dtsgenerator works currently best for me, but can only generate types.
